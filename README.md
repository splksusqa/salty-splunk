# About

This is a Splunk internal project that uses saltstack (http://www.saltstack.com/) 
to do provisioning, orchestration, and testing. This project amis to minimize the 
efforts to setup, control, and run tests over arbitrary deployments. By utilizing salt's
ability to run remote execution, we can focus on writing python modules that's just
like running the python script locally. Hence, the framework also minimizes the efforts
to write testing scripts for complex Splunk deployments.
